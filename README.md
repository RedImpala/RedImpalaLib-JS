RedImpalaLib-JS
============

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/RedImpala/chat.png)](https://gitter.im/RedImpala/chat)

A library to easily interact with Dashlane's secure data.

*NOTE* : This library is still extremely experimental. The idea is to be able
to look up a password as easily as `dashlanejs.getPasswords("http://someUrl");`.

Of course, we also intend to work with the other information stored on dashlane
servers, such as identities, payment information, etc...

For some low-level information of how dashlane works, the following [gist][gist]
are my notes about the ins and outs of the system.
